## Description

This project is to create a note taking application that will write and save notes. We are utiiizing
the express package in node.js. From the command line, the user runs the server.js to start the application.
This will run on http://localhost: 3001 so then the user can run the app in the browser. The user inputs the title of 
the note and then some text for the note. This pulls up a save icon button in the menu, and then they can save
to the page. The can then click the plus button to write a new note.


## Installation

Node.js needs to be installed as well as npm, which contains the express package.
